/**
 * Gates a popup's keyboard focus ring on keyboard use.
 *
 * Rows take focus as a popup opens (the primitive's own autofocus, or the
 * popup's first-row focus), and Chrome grants `:focus-visible` to any
 * script-driven focus — so without a gate every pointer-opened popup would
 * open with a ring on its first row. The flag is seeded at open from the
 * element that has focus then: a trigger reached by keyboard matches
 * `:focus-visible`, a clicked one doesn't. Navigation keys inside the popup
 * earn the ring afterwards. Attach `trackKeyboardNav` in the CAPTURE phase —
 * the primitive moves focus during its own keydown handling, so the flag
 * must be set before then.
